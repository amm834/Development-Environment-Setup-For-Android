This book is just a guideline for developers who want to develope their softwares in Android Linux.
In Android Linux, we can do many stuffs but don't forget everything will not work on it well.

# What can Android do?

In Android Linux you can develope (or) learn web application developement, system adminstration, hacking something, etc.
Sometime,we will need `root` access of Android Device but it is not necessary for ever.

# What will we use?

We will use `Termux` (a terminal emulator for Android) to run Linux/Unix commands and it will help us to install compilers such as PHP,Rust,C/C++ and etc.
`Termux` will help us to develope our applications in Android Linux.
